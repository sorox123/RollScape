# Competitive Analysis & Market Positioning

## Executive Summary

Our D&D app enters a mature VTT (Virtual Tabletop) market dominated by Roll20 (15M+ users), D&D Beyond (official tools), and Foundry VTT (modern alternative). **Critical finding: NO major competitor has integrated AI comprehensively.** This represents a massive blue ocean opportunity.

**Market Gap**: Users are drowning in prep time, struggling with complexity, and lack AI-powered storytelling assistance. Our AI-first approach addresses all three simultaneously.

## Campaign Archiving System

### How It Works:

**Automatic Archiving:**

2. **Day 25**: Warning email sent to DM and players
   - "Your campaign '[Name]' will be archived in 5 days due to inactivity"
   - One-click link to "Keep Active"
3. **Day 30**: Campaign auto-archives
   - Moves to "Archived Campaigns" section
   - All data preserved (fully restorable)
   - Stops counting toward active campaign limits
   - Reduces database load

**Manual Archiving:**
- DM can manually archive any campaign
- Players can archive campaigns they're in (for themselves only)

**Restoration:**
- One-click "Restore Campaign" button
- Takes 5-30 seconds to reload
- All data intact (characters, sessions, state)
- Seamless return to gameplay

**Tier-Specific Archiving:**

| Tier | Archive After | Extended Grace | Manual Archive |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Free** | 30 days | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Creator** | 45 days | ✅ +15 days | ✅ |
| **Master** | Never | ✅ Infinite | ✅ |

**Benefits:**
- **For Users**: Never lose campaign data, clean active campaign list
- **For Us**: Reduced database costs, improved performance, better UX
- **For System**: Distinguish "paused" from "abandoned" campaigns

**Storage:**
```
Active Campaign: Hot storage (PostgreSQL + Redis)
Archived Campaign: Cold storage (S3/compressed JSON)
  - 90% cost reduction
  - Quick restoration (<30 seconds)
  - Full data preservation
```

  DEFAULT 'active';

ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN last_activity TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN archived_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN archive_notification_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Index for efficient archive queries
CREATE INDEX idx_campaigns_status_activity ON campaigns(status, last_activity);
```

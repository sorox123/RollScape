  - Double-zero commonly interpreted as 100
  - Percentile dice sets sold with one die 0-9, other 00-90 in increments of 10

## Key Observations

### Platonic Solid Properties
- Five Platonic solids exist: Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Dodecahedron, Icosahedron
- All were known to ancient Greeks and described by Plato ca. 350 BC
- Predating Plato, neolithic people of Scotland developed models a thousand years earlier (kept in Ashmolean Museum, Oxford)
- All faces of a Platonic solid are congruent regular polygons
- All vertices lie on a sphere (circumscribed)
- All dihedral angles are equal
- All solid angles are equivalent

### Dual Relationships
- **Tetrahedron** is self-dual
- **Cube** ↔ **Octahedron** are duals
- **Dodecahedron** ↔ **Icosahedron** are duals
- The pentagonal trapezohedron (d10) is dual to the pentagonal antiprism

### Face Number Patterns
- d4, d6, d8, d12, d20 follow Platonic solid counts: 4, 6, 8, 12, 20
- d10 breaks the pattern as a non-Platonic solid
- Edge counts: d4=6, d6=12, d8=12, d10=20, d12=30, d20=30

### Historical Context
- 20-sided dice date to 2nd century CE (Roman) and 2nd century BCE (Ptolemaic Egypt)
- Pentagonal trapezohedron patented for gaming in 1906
- Modern polyhedral dice sets popularized around late 1960s with wargaming
- Extensively used in role-playing games since then

### Opposite Face Relationships
- **d6 (Cube):** Opposite faces sum to 7
- **d8 (Octahedron):** Opposite faces usually sum to 9
- **d12 (Dodecahedron):** Opposite faces usually sum to 13
- **d20 (Icosahedron):** Opposite faces sum to 21 (if numbered 1-20)
- **d10:** Often has odd numbers at one sharp apex, even at the other
- **d4:** Cannot have opposite faces (geometrically impossible)

### Chirality
- Western dice are typically "right-handed" (1, 2, 3 run counterclockwise around a vertex)
- Chinese dice are typically "left-handed" (1, 2, 3 run clockwise)
- Applies to cube (d6) construction
